-Run.Nunit.Against(assembly_name).OutputTo("")
-Review visibility of methods
-Exceptions still seem to be happening but the application continues (event not firing immediately?)
-Have a Run.MSBuild or Build.MsBuild item that finds msbuild for you (and the appropriate framework)
-BuildArtifact.Execute().WithArgs()....etc. may be nice
-For BuildASMInfo files if things are not specified then they should not appear as an attribute
