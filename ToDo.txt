Build
  This release


  Next Release
    -Recurse all subfolders does not seem to fit well into the BuildFolder structure (neither does Files(filter) seem to fit)
		Folder.Subfolder("Tests").CreateFileSetString.RecurseAllSubfolders.Files("*.cs");
    -Finds the highest framework and uses that (unless specified otherwise). Currently default is .NET4
    -Add a debug switch that will call Debugger.Invoke() on startup
	-Increase method documentation
	-Review visibility of methods
	-Review message output and verbosity. I think a 0 would be nothing. 1 would be which tasks. 2 would be events in the task. 

  Future Releases
    -Token replacement should allow you to specify the delimiter around the token.
	-Add in architecture detection
	-Zip might want to be Run.Zip.Compress.On(buildArtifact/BuildFolder).OutputTo(dest.zip)
	-BuildArtifact.Execute().WithArgs()....etc. may be nice
	-ability to specify (or detect) compiler to use for build files (current default is c#)
	-ability to reference (or detect) other assemblies in the build file
	-Script to convert nant files to the start of a fluent build file (there is a really rough one in the source repository).
		IDEA: use the nant code base to parse the nant file and then inspect the objects to generate the FluentBuild file.
	-Security Audit functionality build in. Check release build, custom errors, compilation debug=false, trace off, identity element containing password, connection strings (in any element including sessionState) should not have a password, warn on trust level not being set?
	-May want to hide classes outside of core namespace from intellisense to help make things clearer. [Browsable(false)] & [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]


Database
-Have a local sql file folder that merges the changes in so you don't run your own SQL scripts on your own DB.
i.e. scripts/
			Create
			Update
			ToMerge
			
-undo scripts?
-sql script may want to get the changeset version number preprended so that conflicts don't occur 
	(i.e. I name my file 0001_helloWorld.sql and another dev names his 0001_dropDAtabase.sql which one runs first?)
