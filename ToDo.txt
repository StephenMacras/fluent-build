Build
  Completed
    -Add a Run.Debug which will call Debugger.Invoke() when hit
	-Increase method documentation
	-Review visibility of methods

  This release
    -Finds the highest framework and uses that (unless specified otherwise). Currently default is .NET4
	-Support for multiple frameworks
	-Force a TargetType
	-review TODOs
	
  Next Release
  	-Add in ILMerge support / ILMerge in sharpzlib
    -Review exception types and get rid of ApplicationException where necessary
    -Recurse all subfolders does not seem to fit well into the BuildFolder structure (neither does Files(filter) seem to fit)
		Folder.Subfolder("Tests").CreateFileSetString.RecurseAllSubfolders.Files("*.cs");
	-Review message output and verbosity. I think a 0 would be nothing. 1 would be which tasks. 2 would be events in the task. 
	-Add BuildArtifact.Move
	-TeamCity/CCNet/Team blech support
	-Runners should be able to have their own message processor so it can determine messages. i.e. Nunit runner should be able to rpocess messages and show errors if they occur.
	-Setting a debug state on the application (instead of the message logger) should allow other parts to determine what to do based on debug state
	
  Future Releases
    -version check that runs in the background and alerts on next run
    -Token replacement should allow you to specify the delimiter around the token.
	-Add in architecture detection
	-Zip might want to be Run.Zip.Compress.On(buildArtifact/BuildFolder).OutputTo(dest.zip)
	-BuildArtifact.Execute().WithArgs()....etc. may be nice
	-ability to specify (or detect) compiler to use for build files (current default is c#)
	-ability to reference (or detect) other assemblies in the build file
	-Script to convert nant files to the start of a fluent build file (there is a really rough one in the source repository).
		IDEA: use the nant code base to parse the nant file and then inspect the objects to generate the FluentBuild file.
	-Security Audit functionality build in. Check release build, custom errors, compilation debug=false, trace off, identity element containing password, connection strings (in any element including sessionState) should not have a password, warn on trust level not being set?
	-May want to hide classes outside of core namespace from intellisense to help make things clearer. [Browsable(false)] & [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
	-Add in support for publishing to GoogleCode/CodePlex/SourceForge/Etc.
	-It would be nice to have zip be able to output to the folder containing source. I.e. zip("c:\\temp\\).OutputTo("c:\\temp\\out.zip"). 
	-For MSBuild might want to have Configuration.Debug .Release .Custom("myconfig")
	-CopyBuildArtifact may want to have it return a new BuildArtifact with the folder.

Database
-Have a local sql file folder that merges the changes in so you don't run your own SQL scripts on your own DB.
i.e. scripts/
			Create
			Update
			ToMerge
			
-undo scripts?
-sql script may want to get the changeset version number preprended so that conflicts don't occur 
	(i.e. I name my file 0001_helloWorld.sql and another dev names his 0001_dropDAtabase.sql which one runs first?)
