Build
  This release
    -More unit testing
	-More functional testing
	-BuildEXE should fail assembly if it has no tasks.

  Next Release
    -Finds the highest framework and uses that (unless specified otherwise). Currently default is .NET4
    -Remove building from source + space bar / Add a debug switch that will call Debugger.Invoke() on startup
	-Increase method documentation
	-Review visibility of methods
	-Review message output and verbosity. I think a 0 would be nothing. 1 would be which tasks. 2 would be events in the task. 
	-Add debug statements where necessary.


  Future Releases
	-Add in architecture detection
	-BuildArtifact.Execute().WithArgs()....etc. may be nice
	-ability to specify (or detect) compiler to use for build files (current default is c#)
	-ability to reference (or detect) other assemblies in the build file
	-Script to convert nant files to the start of a fluent build file (there is a really rough one in the source repository)
	-Security Audit functionality build in. Check release build, custom errors, compilation debug=false, trace off, identity element containing password, connection strings (in any element including sessionState) should not have a password, warn on trust level not being set?
	-May want to hide classes outside of core namespace from intellisense to help make things clearer. [Browsable(false)] & [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]


Database
-Have a local sql file folder that merges the changes in so you don't run your own SQL scripts on your own DB.
i.e. scripts/
			Create
			Update
			ToMerge
			
-undo scripts?
-sql script may want to get the changeset version number preprended so that conflicts don't occur 
	(i.e. I name my file 0001_helloWorld.sql and another dev names his 0001_dropDAtabase.sql which one runs first?)
