Build
  This release
	-Exceptions still seem to be happening but the application continues (event not firing immediately?)
	   might be that exe's that return error code 1 don't throw an exception
	-More functional testing


  Future releases
    -Add a debug switch that will call Debugger.Invoke() on startup
	-Increase method documentation
	-Review visibility of methods
	-Review message output and verbosity. I think a 0 would be nothing. 1 would be which tasks. 2 would be events in the task. 
	-Add debug statements where necessary.
	-Add in ZIP support
	-Add in architecture detection
	-BuildArtifact.Execute().WithArgs()....etc. may be nice
	-ability to specify (or detect) compiler to use for build files
	-ability to reference (or detect) other assemblies in the build file
	-Script to convert nant files to the start of a fluent build file

Database
-Have a local sql file folder that merges the changes in so you don't run your own SQL scripts on your own DB.
-sql script may want to get the changeset version number preprended so that conflicts don't occur 
	(i.e. I name my file 0001_helloWorld.sql and another dev names his 0001_dropDAtabase.sql which one runs first?)
